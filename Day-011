1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

STATEMENT
There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with 
a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.
You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. 
For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].
Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. 
If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least 
one valid solution for the given input.

SOLUTION
class Solution
{
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int> &group )
    {
        vector<vector<int>>ans;
        int n=group.size();
        map<int, vector<int>>mp;


        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            mp[group[i]].push_back(i);
            if(mp[group[i]].size()==group[i])
            {
                ans.push_back(mp[group[i]]);
                mp[group[i]].clear();
            }
        }

        return ans;

    }
};
