392. Is Subsequence

STATEMENT
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of 
the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

SOLUTION
class Solution
{
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t)
    {
        int n=s.size(), m=t.size();

        int i=0, j=0;
        while(i<n && j<m)
        {
            if(s[i]==t[j])
            {
                i++, j++;
            }
            else
            {
                j++;
            }
        }
        if(i==n)
        {
            return true;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }

    }
};
